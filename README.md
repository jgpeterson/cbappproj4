Chester Bennington Fan Site by: James Peterson

For my fourth and final project in WDI12, I created an app that allows fans of Linkin Park to gather in one place in to share their memories in honor of the late Chester Bennington. When users go to create an account on the Street Team Page, they are given the option to submit a profile picture, how long they have been a fan, and what their favorite album and song is. After they create an account, theyre given the options to post concert photos and fan art on the Fans page and give a description underneath the photo. They can view all of Linkin Parks hit video singles under the singles page and view their entire discography, with the option to purchase any album, on the discography page. Admin features include being able to add/delete a user.

Technologies used:

HTML5 CSS Ruby React Heroku (used to deploy the finalized working app)

FEATURES: Videos for each single presented. Cover art of each album presented with a clickable link below that allows you to buy/stream album selected.

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT:

As with the last project, I would love to make my website responsive mobile friendly. I would also like for users to be able to upload custom made mp3s to the site as well as download other user created songs that are posted. That will definitely be a goal to come back and reach at a later time. I will say that I feel this is my best work and was very passionate about it and wanted to make it the best that I could, not only for employers to see, but to honor the life of Chester Bennington. I really enjoyed this project and using React on Rails to create it. Doing the Bog App repeatedly for several days before being assigned this project really REALLY helped.
