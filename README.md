For my fourth and final project in WDI12, I created an app that allows fans of Linkin Park to gather in one place in to share their memories in honor of the late Chester Bennington. When users go to create an account on the Street Team Page, they are given the option to submit a profile picture, how long they have been a fan, and what their favorite album and song is. After they create an account, theyre given the options to post concert photos and fan art on the Fans page and give a description underneath the photo. They can view all of Linkin Parks hit video singles under the singles page and view their entire discography, with the option to purchase any album, on the discography page. Admin features include being able to add/delete a user.

Technologies used:

HTML5 CSS Ruby React Heroku (used to deploy the finalized working app)

FEATURES: Videos for each single presented. Cover art of each album presented with a clickable link below that allows you to buy/stream album selected.

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT:

I would love to make my website responsive mobile friendly. I tried for several hours the day before presentations to get it right and working and I failed about halfway through. That will definitely be a goal to come back and reach once the course ends so that I can have one site in my portfolio that is mobile friendly. I will say that I feel far far better at the end of this project than I did at the beginning of this project. Having the annotations and stuff that Danny and Jamie wrote in while working and building really really helped me understand how react works. It is still a bit tedious and complicated but I do feel far better at reading and understanding it as well as using it than I did the day they introduced it.
