For my fourth and final project in WDI12, I created an app that allows fans of Linkin Park to gather in one place in honor of the late Chester Bennington. When users go to create an account on the Street Team Page, they are given the option to submit how long they have been a fan, what their favorite album and song is, and a profile picture. After they create an account, theyre given the option to post concert photos and fan art on the Fans page and give it a description. They can view all of Linkin Parks hit singles under the singles page and view their discography, with the option to purchase an album, on the discography page. Admin features include being able to add/delete a user.

Technologies used:

HTML5 CSS JavaScript jQuery Node.js Express.js React MongoDB.js Heroku (used to deploy the finalized working app)

FEATURES: Trailers for each movie presented. Screenshot of each movie presented with the review flex wrapped around the image. Clickable link that allows you to buy/rent movie selected.

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT:

I would love to make my website responsive mobile friendly. I tried for several hours the day before presentations to get it right and working and I failed about halfway through. That will definitely be a goal to come back and reach once the course ends so that I can have one site in my portfolio that is mobile friendly. I will say that I feel far far better at the end of this project than I did at the beginning of this project. Having the annotations and stuff that Danny and Jamie wrote in while working and building really really helped me understand how react works. It is still a bit tedious and complicated but I do feel far better at reading and understanding it as well as using it than I did the day they introduced it.
